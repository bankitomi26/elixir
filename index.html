      <h1>Critical aspects</h1>
      <p class="lead"><a class="navbar-brand" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mZfksRzb3HDrgLNB8">John the Baptist icon - Criticism from Simeon</a></p>
      <p>As for John the Baptist, I think it's basically good. First, it is recognizable that he is, and that is an important achievement. Her hair is very good, and that’s the basic thing about her, because that’s one of her main personal traits: the “tousled,” prophet offensive. Christ was always well combed. St. Andrew is tousled, St. Peter is relatively short-haired and curly ... The posture is also good: he is leaning forward a little, but perceptibly, towards the future. This is also good! The 3/4 face perspective is also okay. It’s hard to write about colors because I only have one - as I have a printed version. I feel the frame is a little too red for that, something deeper burgundy might have been better. The dress is also a little too "pot blue" - at least in print. Caution! Blue is the color of the deity icon. St. John carries the colors of the earth, and if it is blue, it is darker blue. (Except for an example sent to you - which, however, is already an overloaded, somewhat decadent piece.) They usually paint their clothes more wrinkled, "crumpled" - but of course your icon is very small. Finally, one more important thing: the hand is very important. Especially in the case of St. John, who is most often in a deesis position. That is, with two (mediator) prayers raised with open hands (cf. P1010010, P1010013), or with text in his hand. The hands-free "ID photo" icon is very rare and is only used for minor saints.</p>

      <h1>Practical implementation</h1>
      <p class="lead"><a class="navbar-brand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Circle">Ikonoklastia after Malevich - The new icon </a></p>
      <p> The reinterpretation of the icon with the aesthetics of modern art, with Malevich’s supremacism, is finally freed from the balance of the objective world. The suprematist icon no longer has a figurative depiction referring to the transcendent. The ritual tradition that connected holiness with icon painting is separated by the difference between abstraction into pure forms and false ritual. To understand the new icon, we can only get from here in a way in which we have to separate the works of modern art and the method of creating religious rituals. But to implement the modern icon, it is essential to understand the traditions of the icon, to put it into practice. We have to walk through the steps leading to suprematism to look back to understand the process declared to be the end of painting.</p>
