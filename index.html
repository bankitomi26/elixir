      <h1>Critical aspects</h1>
      <p class="lead">John the Baptist icon - Criticism from Simeon</p>
      <p>As for John the Baptist, I think it's basically good. First, it is recognizable that he is, and that is an important achievement. Her hair is very good, and that’s the basic thing about her, because that’s one of her main personal traits: the “tousled,” prophet offensive. Christ was always well combed. St. Andrew is tousled, St. Peter is relatively short-haired and curly ... The posture is also good: he is leaning forward a little, but perceptibly, towards the future. This is also good! The 3/4 face perspective is also okay. It’s hard to write about colors because I only have one - as I have a printed version. I feel the frame is a little too red for that, something deeper burgundy might have been better. The dress is also a little too "pot blue" - at least in print. Caution! Blue is the color of the deity icon. St. John carries the colors of the earth, and if it is blue, it is darker blue. (Except for an example sent to you - which, however, is already an overloaded, somewhat decadent piece.) They usually paint their clothes more wrinkled, "crumpled" - but of course your icon is very small. Finally, one more important thing: the hand is very important. Especially in the case of St. John, who is most often in a deesis position. That is, with two (mediator) prayers raised with open hands (cf. P1010010, P1010013), or with text in his hand. The hands-free "ID photo" icon is very rare and is only used for minor saints.</p>
